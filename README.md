Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what you need to do.



# Programming Languages 

Python

SQLAlchemy

Pandas

Matplotlib

API 
### Precipitation Analysis

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.

* Select only the `date` and `prcp` values.

* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

* Sort the DataFrame values by `date`.

* Plot the results using the DataFrame `plot` method.



* Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

### Station Analysis

* Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.

* Design a query to find the most active stations.

  * List the stations and observation counts in descending order.

  * Which station has the highest number of observations?

  * Hint: You will need to use functions in your SQL query, such as `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `AVG()`, and `COUNT()` in your queries.

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).

  * Filter by the station with the highest number of observations.

  * Plot the results as a histogram with `bins=12`.

## Step 2 - Climate App

Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.

* Use Flask to create your routes.

### Routes

* `/`

  * Home page.

  * List all routes that are available.

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

  * Convert the query results to a dictionary using `date` as the key and `prcp` as the value.

  * Return the JSON representation of your dictionary.

* `/api/v1.0/stations`

  * Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

* `/api/v1.0/tobs`
  * Query the dates and temperature observations of the most active station for the last year of data.
  
  * Return a JSON list of temperature observations (TOBS) for the previous year.

* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

  * Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range.

  * When given the start only, calculate `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for all dates greater than and equal to the start date.

  * When given the start and the end date, calculate the `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for dates between the start and end date inclusive.

## Part 3: Data Analyses

* The following are challenge queries. These are intended to sharpen your ability to work with SQL and Python to conduct advanced analytics.

### Temperature Analysis I

* Hawaii is reputed to enjoy mild weather all year. Is there a meaningful difference between the temperature in, for example, June and December?

* You may either use SQLAlchemy or pandas's `read_csv()` to perform this portion.

* Identify the average temperature in June at all stations across all available years in the dataset. Do the same for December temperature.

* Use the t-test to determine whether the difference in the means, if any, is statistically significant. Will you use a paired t-test, or an unpaired t-test? Why?

### Temperature Analysis II

* The starter notebook contains a function called `calc_temps` that will accept a start date and end date in the format `%Y-%m-%d`. The function will return the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for that range of dates.

* Use the `calc_temps` function to calculate the min, avg, and max temperatures for your trip using the matching dates from the previous year (i.e., use "2017-01-01" if your trip start date was "2018-01-01").

* Plot the min, avg, and max temperature from your previous query as a bar chart.

  * Use the average temperature as the bar height.

  * Use the peak-to-peak (TMAX-TMIN) value as the y error bar (YERR).

  

### Daily Rainfall Average

* Calculate the rainfall per weather station using the previous year's matching dates.

* Calculate the daily normals. Normals are the averages for the min, avg, and max temperatures.

* You are provided with a function called `daily_normals` that will calculate the daily normals for a specific date. This date string will be in the format `%m-%d`. Be sure to use all historic TOBS that match that date string.

* Create a list of dates for your trip in the format `%m-%d`. Use the `daily_normals` function to calculate the normals for each date string and append the results to a list.

* Load the list of daily normals into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index equal to the date.

* Use Pandas to plot an area plot (`stacked=False`) for the daily normals.
